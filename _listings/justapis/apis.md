description: JustAPIs is designed to help developers overcome existing limitations
  when it comes to building APIs. The JustAPIs solution is a high-performance, compiled
  executable that can run on any Linux, Windows, or Mac OSX based hardware, from a
  single developer???s laptop to large-scale, clustered production environments. With
  zero dependencies, JustAPIs can be installed instantly and includes sample APIs
  with familiar JavaScript-based business logic, so developers can be up and running
  with their own API server in minutes.
